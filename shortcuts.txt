To navigate to the implementation(s) of an abstract method, position the caret at its usage or its name in the declaration and press Ctrl+Alt+B.

You can comment or uncomment lines and blocks of code using Ctrl+Slash and Ctrl+Shift+Slash.
Ctrl+Slash comments or uncomments the current line or selected block with single line comments (//...).
Ctrl+Shift+Slash encloses the selected block in a block comment (/*...*/).
To uncomment a commented block press Ctrl+Shift+Slash anywhere inside it.

When you need to cast an expression value to the required type the SmartType code completion will help you. For example, type
String s = (<caret is here> 
and press Ctrl+Shift+Space to see what happens.


Ctrl+D in the editor duplicates the selected block or the current line when no block is selected.
